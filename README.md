# Clear Sans: A free to use, OpenType font

Clear Sans has been recognized as a versatile OpenType font for screen, print, and Web. It was designed with on-screen legibility in mind and strikes a balance between contemporary, professional, and stylish expression and thoroughly functional purpose. It has a sophisticated and elegant personality at all sizes, and its thoughtful design becomes even more evident at the thin weight.

Clear Sans has minimized, unambiguous characters and slightly narrow proportions, making it ideal for UI design. Its strong, recognizable forms avoid distracting ambiguity, making it comfortable for reading short UI labels and long passages in both screen and print.

This font supports a wide range of languages using Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek scripts. The font family includes medium, regular, thin, and light weights with upright, italic, and bold styles.

# Who Itâ€™s For

Clear Sans can be freely utilized by application, browser and operating system developers.

# Project Specifics

Clear Sans is freely available for private and commercial use and distribution under the Apache 2.0 License. While the font is open source, the design files used by Monotype are not available.

# About Intel Involvement

Clear Sans was created and designed by Daniel Ratighan at Monotype under the direction of the User Experience team at Intel's Open Source Technology Center.
